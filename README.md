# Main-Code-and-WAES-Dataset
Based on spaceborne synthetic aperture passive interference imaging technology, a mapping of the electromagnetic spectrum distribution of 5,000 randomly distributed ground radiation sources globally has been conducted, resulting in a space-based wide-area electromagnetic spectrum dataset containing 2,578 maps. The dataset comprises two components: The first part contains electromagnetic spectrum maps for ground radiation sources with omnidirectional antennas, including both ideal error-free cases and those affected by coupling errors; the second part features maps for ground radiation sources with randomized beam performance antennas, covering both ideal error-free cases and scenarios with three types of errors. Synthetic Aperture Parameters: Staggered Y-shaped Omnidirectional element Bandwidth 200 MHz Sampling frequency 500 MHz Angular resolution 1.728° Imaging interval 100 s Integration time 0.1 s Frequency: 2GHz Map size: 748×679 Attenuation: FSPL+ Near-Earth space rain attenuation The spaceborne platform model used for simulation: MATLAB's built-in Two-Line Element Set (TLE) format orbital parameters (leoSatelliteConstellation.tle: Satellite 1 - Satellite 40)

Also attached are the main synthetic aperture imaging code program, the low-orbit satellite dynamic simulation scenario operation program, the antenna random configuration program, and the latitude and longitude coordinate file of 5,000 randomly distributed radiation sources worldwide. Due to the large size of the global region file World_countries.shp used in the simulation experiment, it cannot be uploaded. Therefore, those in need can privately message the author, who will send it to you separately.
The dataset can be applied to spectrum completion, localization, abnormal energy detection, and so on.
